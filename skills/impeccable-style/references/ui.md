description: Universal UI design fundamentals — critique/diagnosis, layout & spacing, typography, simplification, and final polish.
---

Improve the design of an interface using the universal building blocks shared by every good design: layout & white space, typography, visual hierarchy, restraint, and finish.

**How to use this skill:**
- **Diagnose first**: If it is not already clear what is wrong, run the **Critique** pass to find out, then apply the fix passes it recommends.
- **Fix**: Apply **Layout**, **Typeset**, and/or **Distill** as needed.
- **Finish**: Always end with the **Polish** pass.

Whatever the entry point, the **Foundations** section applies to all work — read it first.

## Foundations

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

### Context Gathering Protocol

Design skills produce generic output without project context. You MUST have confirmed design context before doing any design work.

**Required context** (every design skill needs at minimum):
- **Target audience**: Who uses this product and in what context?
- **Use cases**: What jobs are they trying to get done?
- **Brand personality/tone**: How should the interface feel?

Individual sections below may require additional context. Check each section's preparation notes for specifics.

**CRITICAL**: You cannot infer this context by reading the codebase. Code tells you what was built, not who it's for or what it should feel like. Only the creator can provide this context.

**Gathering order:**
1. **Check current instructions (instant)**: If your loaded instructions already contain a **Design Context** section, proceed immediately.
2. **Check .impeccable.md (fast)**: If not in instructions, read `.impeccable.md` from the project root. If it exists and contains the required context, proceed.
3. **Ask the user (REQUIRED)**: If neither source has context, STOP and call the AskUserQuestion tool to gather the three required items above. Then offer to save the answers as a `## Design Context` section in `.impeccable.md` at the project root so future sessions can skip this step. Do NOT attempt to infer context from the codebase instead.

---

### Design Direction

Commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work. The key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

### Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

#### Typography

Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.

<typography_principles>
Always apply these — do not consult a reference, just do them:

- Use a modular type scale with fluid sizing (clamp) for headings on marketing/content pages. Use fixed `rem` scales for app UIs and dashboards (no major design system uses fluid type in product UI).
- Use fewer sizes with more contrast. A 5-step scale with at least a 1.25 ratio between steps creates clearer hierarchy than 8 sizes that are 1.1× apart.
- Line-height scales inversely with line length. Narrow columns want tighter leading, wide columns want more. For light text on dark backgrounds, ADD 0.05-0.1 to your normal line-height — light type reads as lighter weight and needs more breathing room.
- Cap line length at ~65-75ch. Body text wider than that is fatiguing.
</typography_principles>

<font_selection_procedure>
DO THIS BEFORE TYPING ANY FONT NAME.

The model's natural failure mode is "I was told not to use Inter, so I will pick my next favorite font, which becomes the new monoculture." Avoid this by performing the following procedure on every project, in order:

Step 1. Read the brief once. Write down 3 concrete words for the brand voice (e.g., "warm and mechanical and opinionated", "calm and clinical and careful", "fast and dense and unimpressed", "handmade and a little weird"). NOT "modern" or "elegant" — those are dead categories.

Step 2. List the 3 fonts you would normally reach for given those words. Write them down. They are most likely from this list:

<reflex_fonts_to_reject>
Fraunces
Newsreader
Lora
Crimson
Crimson Pro
Crimson Text
Playfair Display
Cormorant
Cormorant Garamond
Syne
IBM Plex Mono
IBM Plex Sans
IBM Plex Serif
Space Mono
Space Grotesk
Inter
DM Sans
DM Serif Display
DM Serif Text
Outfit
Plus Jakarta Sans
Instrument Sans
Instrument Serif
</reflex_fonts_to_reject>

Reject every font that appears in the reflex_fonts_to_reject list. They are your training-data defaults and they create monoculture across projects.

Step 3. Browse a font catalog with the 3 brand words in mind. Sources: Google Fonts, Pangram Pangram, Future Fonts, Adobe Fonts, ABC Dinamo, Klim Type Foundry, Velvetyne. Look for something that fits the brand as a *physical object* — a museum exhibit caption, a hand-painted shop sign, a 1970s mainframe terminal manual, a fabric label on the inside of a coat, a children's book printed on cheap newsprint. Reject the first thing that "looks designy" — that's the trained reflex too. Keep looking.

Step 4. Cross-check the result. The right font for an "elegant" brief is NOT necessarily a serif. The right font for a "technical" brief is NOT necessarily a sans-serif. The right font for a "warm" brief is NOT Fraunces. If your final pick lines up with your reflex pattern, go back to Step 3.
</font_selection_procedure>

<typography_rules>
DO use a modular type scale with fluid sizing (clamp) on headings.
DO vary font weights and sizes to create clear visual hierarchy.
DO vary your font choices across projects. If you used a serif display font on the last project, look for a sans, monospace, or display face on this one.

DO NOT use overused fonts like Inter, Roboto, Arial, Open Sans, or system defaults — but also do not simply switch to your second-favorite. Every font in the reflex_fonts_to_reject list above is banned. Look further.
DO NOT use monospace typography as lazy shorthand for "technical/developer" vibes.
DO NOT put large icons with rounded corners above every heading. They rarely add value and make sites look templated.
DO NOT use only one font family for the entire page. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
DO NOT use a flat type hierarchy where sizes are too close together. Aim for at least a 1.25 ratio between steps.
DO NOT set long body passages in uppercase. Reserve all-caps for short labels and headings.
</typography_rules>

#### Color & Theme

Commit to a cohesive palette. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.

<color_principles>
Always apply these — do not consult a reference, just do them:

- Use OKLCH, not HSL. OKLCH is perceptually uniform: equal steps in lightness *look* equal, which HSL does not deliver. As you move toward white or black, REDUCE chroma — high chroma at extreme lightness looks garish. A light blue at 85% lightness wants ~0.08 chroma, not the 0.15 of your base color.
- Tint your neutrals toward your brand hue. Even a chroma of 0.005-0.01 is perceptible and creates subconscious cohesion between brand color and UI surfaces. The hue you tint toward should come from THIS brand, not from a "warm = friendly" or "cool = tech" formula. Pick the brand's actual hue first, then tint everything toward it.
- The 60-30-10 rule is about visual *weight*, not pixel count. 60% neutral / surface, 30% secondary text and borders, 10% accent. Accents work BECAUSE they're rare. Overuse kills their power.
</color_principles>

<theme_selection>
Theme (light vs dark) should be DERIVED from audience and viewing context, not picked from a default. Read the brief and ask: when is this product used, by whom, in what physical setting?

- A perp DEX consumed during fast trading sessions → dark
- A hospital portal consumed by anxious patients on phones late at night → light
- A children's reading app → light
- A vintage motorcycle forum where users sit in their garage at 9pm → dark
- An observability dashboard for SREs in a dark office → dark
- A wedding planning checklist for couples on a Sunday morning → light
- A music player app for headphone listening at night → dark
- A food magazine homepage browsed during a coffee break → light

Do not default everything to light "to play it safe." Do not default everything to dark "to look cool." Both defaults are the lazy reflex. The correct theme is the one the actual user wants in their actual context.
</theme_selection>

<color_rules>
DO use modern CSS color functions (oklch, color-mix, light-dark) for perceptually uniform, maintainable palettes.
DO tint your neutrals toward your brand hue. Even a subtle hint creates subconscious cohesion.

DO NOT use gray text on colored backgrounds; it looks washed out. Use a shade of the background color instead.
DO NOT use pure black (#000) or pure white (#fff). Always tint; pure black/white never appears in nature.
DO NOT use the AI color palette: cyan-on-dark, purple-to-blue gradients, neon accents on dark backgrounds.
DO NOT use gradient text for impact — see <absolute_bans> below for the strict definition. Solid colors only for text.
DO NOT default to dark mode with glowing accents. It looks "cool" without requiring actual design decisions.
DO NOT default to light mode "to be safe" either. The point is to choose, not to retreat to a safe option.
</color_rules>

#### Layout & Space

Create visual rhythm through varied spacing, not the same padding everywhere. Embrace asymmetry and unexpected compositions. Break the grid intentionally for emphasis.

<spatial_principles>
Always apply these — do not consult a reference, just do them:

- Use a 4pt spacing scale with semantic token names (`--space-sm`, `--space-md`), not pixel-named (`--spacing-8`). Scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96. 8pt is too coarse — you'll often want 12px between two values.
- Use `gap` instead of margins for sibling spacing. It eliminates margin collapse and the cleanup hacks that come with it.
- Vary spacing for hierarchy. A heading with extra space above it reads as more important — make use of that. Don't apply the same padding everywhere.
- Self-adjusting grid pattern: `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr))` is the breakpoint-free responsive grid for card-style content.
- Container queries are for components, viewport queries are for page layout. A card in a sidebar should adapt to the sidebar's width, not the viewport's.
</spatial_principles>

<spatial_rules>
DO create visual rhythm through varied spacing: tight groupings, generous separations.
DO use fluid spacing with clamp() that breathes on larger screens.
DO use asymmetry and unexpected compositions; break the grid intentionally for emphasis.

DO NOT wrap everything in cards. Not everything needs a container.
DO NOT nest cards inside cards. Visual noise; flatten the hierarchy.
DO NOT use identical card grids (same-sized cards with icon + heading + text, repeated endlessly).
DO NOT use the hero metric layout template (big number, small label, supporting stats, gradient accent).
DO NOT center everything. Left-aligned text with asymmetric layouts feels more designed.
DO NOT use the same spacing everywhere. Without rhythm, layouts feel monotonous.
DO NOT let body text wrap beyond ~80 characters per line. Add a max-width like 65–75ch so the eye can track easily.
</spatial_rules>

#### Visual Details

<absolute_bans>
These CSS patterns are NEVER acceptable. They are the most recognizable AI design tells. Match-and-refuse: if you find yourself about to write any of these, stop and rewrite the element with a different structure entirely.

BAN 1: Side-stripe borders on cards/list items/callouts/alerts
  - PATTERN: `border-left:` or `border-right:` with width greater than 1px
  - INCLUDES: hard-coded colors AND CSS variables
  - FORBIDDEN: `border-left: 3px solid red`, `border-left: 4px solid #ff0000`, `border-left: 4px solid var(--color-warning)`, `border-left: 5px solid oklch(...)`, etc.
  - WHY: this is the single most overused "design touch" in admin, dashboard, and medical UIs. It never looks intentional regardless of color, radius, opacity, or whether the variable name is "primary" or "warning" or "accent."
  - REWRITE: use a different element structure entirely. Do not just swap to box-shadow inset. Reach for full borders, background tints, leading numbers/icons, or no visual indicator at all.

BAN 2: Gradient text
  - PATTERN: `background-clip: text` (or `-webkit-background-clip: text`) combined with a gradient background
  - FORBIDDEN: any combination that makes text fill come from a `linear-gradient`, `radial-gradient`, or `conic-gradient`
  - WHY: gradient text is decorative rather than meaningful and is one of the top three AI design tells
  - REWRITE: use a single solid color for text. If you want emphasis, use weight or size, not gradient fill.
</absolute_bans>

DO: Use intentional, purposeful decorative elements that reinforce brand.
DO NOT: Use border-left or border-right greater than 1px as a colored accent stripe on cards, list items, callouts, or alerts. See <absolute_bans> above for the strict CSS pattern.
DO NOT: Use glassmorphism everywhere (blur effects, glass cards, glow borders used decoratively rather than purposefully).
DO NOT: Use sparklines as decoration. Tiny charts that look sophisticated but convey nothing meaningful.
DO NOT: Use rounded rectangles with generic drop shadows. Safe, forgettable, could be any AI output.
DO NOT: Use modals unless there's truly no better alternative. Modals are lazy.

#### Motion

Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.

**DO**: Use motion to convey state changes: entrances, exits, feedback
**DO**: Use exponential easing (ease-out-quart/quint/expo) for natural deceleration
**DO**: For height animations, use grid-template-rows transitions instead of animating height directly
**DON'T**: Animate layout properties (width, height, padding, margin). Use transform and opacity only
**DON'T**: Use bounce or elastic easing. They feel dated and tacky; real objects decelerate smoothly

#### Interaction

Make interactions feel fast. Use optimistic UI: update immediately, sync later.

**DO**: Use progressive disclosure. Start simple, reveal sophistication through interaction (basic options first, advanced behind expandable sections; hover states that reveal secondary actions)
**DO**: Design empty states that teach the interface, not just say "nothing here"
**DO**: Make every interactive surface feel intentional and responsive
**DON'T**: Repeat the same information (redundant headers, intros that restate the heading)
**DON'T**: Make every button primary. Use ghost buttons, text links, secondary styles; hierarchy matters

#### Responsive

**DO**: Use container queries (@container) for component-level responsiveness
**DO**: Adapt the interface for different contexts, not just shrink it
**DON'T**: Hide critical functionality on mobile. Adapt the interface, don't amputate it

#### UX Writing

**DO**: Make every word earn its place
**DON'T**: Repeat information users can already see

---

### The AI Slop Test

**Critical quality check**: If you showed this interface to someone and said "AI made this," would they believe you immediately? If yes, that's the problem.

A distinctive interface should make someone ask "how was this made?" not "which AI made this?"

Review the DON'T guidelines above. They are the fingerprints of AI-generated work from 2024-2025.

---

### Implementation Principles

Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices across generations.

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back. Show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.

---

## Critique

#### Step 1: Preparation

Follow the **Foundations** section above, including the Context Gathering Protocol, before proceeding. Additionally gather: what the interface is trying to accomplish.

#### Step 2: Gather Assessments

Launch two independent assessments. **Neither must see the other's output** to avoid bias.

You SHOULD delegate each assessment to a separate sub-agent for independence. Use your environment's agent spawning mechanism (e.g., Claude Code's `Agent` tool, or Codex's subagent spawning). Sub-agents should return their findings as structured text. Do NOT output findings to the user yet.

If sub-agents are not available in the current environment, complete each assessment sequentially, writing findings to internal notes before proceeding.

**Tab isolation**: When browser automation is available, each assessment MUST create its own new tab. Never reuse an existing tab, even if one is already open at the correct URL. This prevents the two assessments from interfering with each other's page state.

##### Assessment A: LLM Design Review

Read the relevant source files (HTML, CSS, JS/TS) and, if browser automation is available, visually inspect the live page. **Create a new tab** for this; do not reuse existing tabs. After navigation, label the tab by setting the document title:
```javascript
document.title = '[LLM] ' + document.title;
```
Think like a design director. Evaluate:

**AI Slop Detection (CRITICAL)**: Does this look like every other AI-generated interface? Review against ALL **DON'T** guidelines in the impeccable skill. Check for AI color palette, gradient text, dark glows, glassmorphism, hero metric layouts, identical card grids, generic fonts, and all other tells. **The test**: If someone said "AI made this," would you believe them immediately?

**Holistic Design Review**: visual hierarchy (eye flow, primary action clarity), information architecture (structure, grouping, cognitive load), emotional resonance (does it match brand and audience?), discoverability (are interactive elements obvious?), composition (balance, whitespace, rhythm), typography (hierarchy, readability, font choices), color (purposeful use, cohesion, accessibility), states & edge cases (empty, loading, error, success), microcopy (clarity, tone, helpfulness).

**Cognitive Load**:
- Check for overload signals: too many choices per decision point, competing CTAs, unexplained jargon, forced recall (vs recognition), visual noise, interrupted flows, unclear next steps, information without grouping. Report failure count: 0-1 = low (good), 2-3 = moderate, 4+ = critical.
- Count visible options at each decision point. If >4, flag it.
- Check for progressive disclosure: is complexity revealed only when needed?

**Emotional Journey**:
- What emotion does this interface evoke? Is that intentional?
- **Peak-end rule**: Is the most intense moment positive? Does the experience end well?
- **Emotional valleys**: Check for anxiety spikes at high-stakes moments (payment, delete, commit). Are there design interventions (progress indicators, reassurance copy, undo options)?

**Nielsen's Heuristics**:
Score each of the 10 heuristics 0-4 (0 = broken, 1 = major gaps, 2 = partial, 3 = good, 4 = excellent). This scoring will be presented in the report.

Return structured findings covering: AI slop verdict, heuristic scores, cognitive load assessment, what's working (2-3 items), priority issues (3-5 with what/why/fix), minor observations, and provocative questions.

##### Assessment B: Automated Detection

Run the bundled deterministic detector, which flags 25 specific patterns (AI slop tells + general design quality).

**CLI scan**:
```bash
npx impeccable --json [--fast] [target]
```

- Pass HTML/JSX/TSX/Vue/Svelte files or directories as `[target]` (anything with markup). Do not pass CSS-only files.
- For URLs, skip the CLI scan (it requires Puppeteer). Use browser visualization instead.
- For large directories (200+ scannable files), use `--fast` (regex-only, skips jsdom)
- For 500+ files, narrow scope or ask the user
- Exit code 0 = clean, 2 = findings

**Browser visualization** (when browser automation tools are available AND the target is a viewable page):

The overlay is a **visual aid for the user**. It highlights issues directly in their browser. Do NOT scroll through the page to screenshot overlays. Instead, read the console output to get the results programmatically.

1. **Start the live detection server**:
   ```bash
   npx impeccable live &
   ```
   Note the port printed to stdout (auto-assigned). Use `--port=PORT` to fix it.
2. **Create a new tab** and navigate to the page (use dev server URL for local files, or direct URL). Do not reuse existing tabs.
3. **Label the tab** via `javascript_tool` so the user can distinguish it:
   ```javascript
   document.title = '[Human] ' + document.title;
   ```
4. **Scroll to top** to ensure the page is scrolled to the very top before injection
5. **Inject** via `javascript_tool` (replace PORT with the port from step 1):
   ```javascript
   const s = document.createElement('script'); s.src = 'http://localhost:PORT/detect.js'; document.head.appendChild(s);
   ```
6. Wait 2-3 seconds for the detector to render overlays
7. **Read results from console** using `read_console_messages` with pattern `impeccable`. The detector logs all findings with the `[impeccable]` prefix. Do NOT scroll through the page to take screenshots of the overlays.
8. **Cleanup**: Stop the live server when done:
   ```bash
   npx impeccable live stop
   ```

For multi-view targets, inject on 3-5 representative pages. If injection fails, continue with CLI results only.

Return: CLI findings (JSON), browser console findings (if applicable), and any false positives noted.

#### Step 3: Generate Combined Critique Report

Synthesize both assessments into a single report. Do NOT simply concatenate. Weave the findings together, noting where the LLM review and detector agree, where the detector caught issues the LLM missed, and where detector findings are false positives.

Structure your feedback as a design director would:

##### Design Health Score

Present the Nielsen's 10 heuristics scores as a table:

| # | Heuristic | Score | Key Issue |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Visibility of System Status | ? | [specific finding or "n/a" if solid] |
| 2 | Match System / Real World | ? | |
| 3 | User Control and Freedom | ? | |
| 4 | Consistency and Standards | ? | |
| 5 | Error Prevention | ? | |
| 6 | Recognition Rather Than Recall | ? | |
| 7 | Flexibility and Efficiency | ? | |
| 8 | Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | ? | |
| 9 | Error Recovery | ? | |
| 10 | Help and Documentation | ? | |
| **Total** | | **??/40** | **[Rating band]** |

Be honest with scores. A 4 means genuinely excellent. Most real interfaces score 20-32.

##### Anti-Patterns Verdict

**Start here.** Does this look AI-generated?

**LLM assessment**: Your own evaluation of AI slop tells. Cover overall aesthetic feel, layout sameness, generic composition, missed opportunities for personality.

**Deterministic scan**: Summarize what the automated detector found, with counts and file locations. Note any additional issues the detector caught that you missed, and flag any false positives.

**Visual overlays** (if browser was used): Tell the user that overlays are now visible in the **[Human]** tab in their browser, highlighting the detected issues. Summarize what the console output reported.

##### Overall Impression
A brief gut reaction: what works, what doesn't, and the single biggest opportunity.

##### What's Working
Highlight 2-3 things done well. Be specific about why they work.

##### Priority Issues
The 3-5 most impactful design problems, ordered by importance.

For each issue, tag with **P0-P3 severity** (P0 blocking — prevents task completion, fix immediately; P1 major — significant difficulty or WCAG AA violation, fix before release; P2 minor — annoyance with a workaround, fix in next pass; P3 polish — no real user impact, fix if time permits):
- **[P?] What**: Name the problem clearly
- **Why it matters**: How this hurts users or undermines goals
- **Fix**: What to do about it (be concrete)
- **Suggested fix path**: Which section of this skill could address this (Layout, Typeset, Distill, Polish) — or name the broader concern if it falls outside them (e.g. motion, color, copy)

##### Persona Red Flags

Auto-select 2-3 archetypal personas most relevant to this interface type (e.g., power user, first-timer, accessibility user, distracted mobile user, skeptical evaluator). If `CLAUDE.md` or `.impeccable.md` contains a `## Design Context` section, also generate 1-2 project-specific personas from the audience/brand info.

For each selected persona, walk through the primary user action and list specific red flags found:

**Alex (Power User)**: No keyboard shortcuts detected. Form requires 8 clicks for primary action. Forced modal onboarding. High abandonment risk.

**Jordan (First-Timer)**: Icon-only nav in sidebar. Technical jargon in error messages ("404 Not Found"). No visible help. Will abandon at step 2.

Be specific. Name the exact elements and interactions that fail each persona. Don't write generic persona descriptions; write what broke for them.

##### Minor Observations
Quick notes on smaller issues worth addressing.

##### Questions to Consider
Provocative questions that might unlock better solutions:
- "What if the primary action were more prominent?"
- "Does this need to feel this complex?"
- "What would a confident version of this look like?"

**Remember**:
- Be direct. Vague feedback wastes everyone's time.
- Be specific. "The submit button," not "some elements."
- Say what's wrong AND why it matters to users.
- Give concrete suggestions, not just "consider exploring..."
- Prioritize ruthlessly. If everything is important, nothing is.
- Don't soften criticism. Developers need honest feedback to ship great design.

#### Step 4: Ask the User

**After presenting findings**, use targeted questions based on what was actually found. STOP and call the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify. These answers will shape the action plan.

Ask questions along these lines (adapt to the specific findings; do NOT ask generic questions):

1. **Priority direction**: Based on the issues found, ask which category matters most to the user right now. For example: "I found problems with visual hierarchy, color usage, and information overload. Which area should we tackle first?" Offer the top 2-3 issue categories as options.

2. **Design intent**: If the critique found a tonal mismatch, ask whether it was intentional. For example: "The interface feels clinical and corporate. Is that the intended tone, or should it feel warmer/bolder/more playful?" Offer 2-3 tonal directions as options based on what would fix the issues found.

3. **Scope**: Ask how much the user wants to take on. For example: "I found N issues. Want to address everything, or focus on the top 3?" Offer scope options like "Top 3 only", "All issues", "Critical issues only".

4. **Constraints** (optional; only ask if relevant): If the findings touch many areas, ask if anything is off-limits. For example: "Should any sections stay as-is?" This prevents the plan from touching things the user considers done.

**Rules for questions**:
- Every question must reference specific findings from the report. Never ask generic "who is your audience?" questions.
- Keep it to 2-4 questions maximum. Respect the user's time.
- Offer concrete options, not open-ended prompts.
- If findings are straightforward (e.g., only 1-2 clear issues), skip questions and go directly to Step 5.

#### Step 5: Recommended Actions

**After receiving the user's answers**, present a prioritized action summary reflecting the user's priorities and scope from Step 4.

##### Action Summary

List recommended fix passes in priority order, based on the user's answers:

1. **Layout / Typeset / Distill / Polish**: Brief description of what to fix (specific context from critique findings)
2. **{Section}**: Brief description (specific context)
...

**Rules for recommendations**:
- Recommend fixes covered by this skill's sections (Layout, Typeset, Distill, Polish); for issues outside them, describe the fix directly
- Order by the user's stated priorities first, then by impact
- Each item's description should carry enough context that the command knows what to focus on
- Map each Priority Issue to the appropriate section
- Skip sections that would address zero issues
- If the user chose a limited scope, only include items within that scope
- If the user marked areas as off-limits, exclude fixes that would touch those areas
- End with the Polish pass as the final step if any fixes were recommended

After presenting the summary, tell the user:

> You can ask me to run these one at a time, all at once, or in any order you prefer.
>
> Re-run the Critique pass after fixes to see your score improve.

## Layout

Assess and improve layout and spacing that feels monotonous, crowded, or structurally weak — turning generic arrangements into intentional, rhythmic compositions.

### MANDATORY PREPARATION

Follow the **Foundations** section above, including the Context Gathering Protocol, before proceeding.

---

### Assess Current Layout

Analyze what's weak about the current spatial design:

1. **Spacing**:
   - Is spacing consistent or arbitrary? (Random padding/margin values)
   - Is all spacing the same? (Equal padding everywhere = no rhythm)
   - Are related elements grouped tightly, with generous space between groups?

2. **Visual hierarchy**:
   - Apply the squint test: blur your (metaphorical) eyes — can you still identify the most important element, second most important, and clear groupings?
   - Is hierarchy achieved effectively? (Space and weight alone can be enough — but is the current approach working?)
   - Does whitespace guide the eye to what matters?

3. **Grid & structure**:
   - Is there a clear underlying structure, or does the layout feel random?
   - Are identical card grids used everywhere? (Icon + heading + text, repeated endlessly)
   - Is everything centered? (Left-aligned with asymmetric layouts feels more designed, but not a hard and fast rule)

4. **Rhythm & variety**:
   - Does the layout have visual rhythm? (Alternating tight/generous spacing)
   - Is every section structured the same way? (Monotonous repetition)
   - Are there intentional moments of surprise or emphasis?

5. **Density**:
   - Is the layout too cramped? (Not enough breathing room)
   - Is the layout too sparse? (Excessive whitespace without purpose)
   - Does density match the content type? (Data-dense UIs need tighter spacing; marketing pages need more air)

**CRITICAL**: Layout problems are often the root cause of interfaces feeling "off" even when colors and fonts are fine. Space is a design material — use it with intention.

### Plan Layout Improvements

Create a systematic plan:

- **Spacing system**: Use a consistent scale — whether that's a framework's built-in scale (e.g., Tailwind), rem-based tokens, or a custom system. The specific values matter less than consistency.
- **Hierarchy strategy**: How will space communicate importance?
- **Layout approach**: What structure fits the content? Flex for 1D, Grid for 2D, named areas for complex page layouts.
- **Rhythm**: Where should spacing be tight vs generous?

### Improve Layout Systematically

#### Establish a Spacing System

- Use a consistent spacing scale — framework scales (Tailwind, etc.), rem-based tokens, or a custom scale all work. What matters is that values come from a defined set, not arbitrary numbers.
- Name tokens semantically if using custom properties: `--space-xs` through `--space-xl`, not `--spacing-8`
- Use `gap` for sibling spacing instead of margins — eliminates margin collapse hacks
- Apply `clamp()` for fluid spacing that breathes on larger screens

#### Create Visual Rhythm

- **Tight grouping** for related elements (8-12px between siblings)
- **Generous separation** between distinct sections (48-96px)
- **Varied spacing** within sections — not every row needs the same gap
- **Asymmetric compositions** — break the predictable centered-content pattern when it makes sense

#### Choose the Right Layout Tool

- **Use Flexbox for 1D layouts**: Rows of items, nav bars, button groups, card contents, most component internals. Flex is simpler and more appropriate for the majority of layout tasks.
- **Use Grid for 2D layouts**: Page-level structure, dashboards, data-dense interfaces, anything where rows AND columns need coordinated control.
- **Don't default to Grid** when Flexbox with `flex-wrap` would be simpler and more flexible.
- Use `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr))` for responsive grids without breakpoints.
- Use named grid areas (`grid-template-areas`) for complex page layouts — redefine at breakpoints.

#### Break Card Grid Monotony

- Don't default to card grids for everything — spacing and alignment create visual grouping naturally
- Use cards only when content is truly distinct and actionable — never nest cards inside cards
- Vary card sizes, span columns, or mix cards with non-card content to break repetition

#### Strengthen Visual Hierarchy

- Use the fewest dimensions needed for clear hierarchy. Space alone can be enough — generous whitespace around an element draws the eye. Some of the most sophisticated designs achieve rhythm with just space and weight. Add color or size contrast only when simpler means aren't sufficient.
- Be aware of reading flow — in LTR languages, the eye naturally scans top-left to bottom-right, but primary action placement depends on context (e.g., bottom-right in dialogs, top in navigation).
- Create clear content groupings through proximity and separation.

#### Manage Depth & Elevation

- Create a semantic z-index scale (dropdown → sticky → modal-backdrop → modal → toast → tooltip)
- Build a consistent shadow scale (sm → md → lg → xl) — shadows should be subtle
- Use elevation to reinforce hierarchy, not as decoration

#### Optical Adjustments

- If an icon looks visually off-center despite being geometrically centered, nudge it — but only if you're confident it actually looks wrong. Don't adjust speculatively.

**NEVER**:
- Use arbitrary spacing values outside your scale
- Make all spacing equal — variety creates hierarchy
- Wrap everything in cards — not everything needs a container
- Nest cards inside cards — use spacing and dividers for hierarchy within
- Use identical card grids everywhere (icon + heading + text, repeated)
- Center everything — left-aligned with asymmetry feels more designed
- Default to the hero metric layout (big number, small label, stats, gradient) as a template. If showing real user data, a prominent metric can work — but it should display actual data, not decorative numbers.
- Default to CSS Grid when Flexbox would be simpler — use the simplest tool for the job
- Use arbitrary z-index values (999, 9999) — build a semantic scale

### Verify Layout Improvements

- **Squint test**: Can you identify primary, secondary, and groupings with blurred vision?
- **Rhythm**: Does the page have a satisfying beat of tight and generous spacing?
- **Hierarchy**: Is the most important content obvious within 2 seconds?
- **Breathing room**: Does the layout feel comfortable, not cramped or wasteful?
- **Consistency**: Is the spacing system applied uniformly?
- **Responsiveness**: Does the layout adapt gracefully across screen sizes?

Remember: Space is the most underused design tool. A layout with the right rhythm and hierarchy can make even simple content feel polished and intentional.

## Typeset

Assess and improve typography that feels generic, inconsistent, or poorly structured — turning default-looking text into intentional, well-crafted type.

### MANDATORY PREPARATION

Follow the **Foundations** section above, including the Context Gathering Protocol, before proceeding.

---

### Assess Current Typography

Analyze what's weak or generic about the current type:

1. **Font choices**:
   - Are we using invisible defaults? (Inter, Roboto, Arial, Open Sans, system defaults)
   - Does the font match the brand personality? (A playful brand shouldn't use a corporate typeface)
   - Are there too many font families? (More than 2-3 is almost always a mess)

2. **Hierarchy**:
   - Can you tell headings from body from captions at a glance?
   - Are font sizes too close together? (14px, 15px, 16px = muddy hierarchy)
   - Are weight contrasts strong enough? (Medium vs Regular is barely visible)

3. **Sizing & scale**:
   - Is there a consistent type scale, or are sizes arbitrary?
   - Does body text meet minimum readability? (16px+)
   - Is the sizing strategy appropriate for the context? (Fixed `rem` scales for app UIs; fluid `clamp()` for marketing/content page headings)

4. **Readability**:
   - Are line lengths comfortable? (45-75 characters ideal)
   - Is line-height appropriate for the font and context?
   - Is there enough contrast between text and background?

5. **Consistency**:
   - Are the same elements styled the same way throughout?
   - Are font weights used consistently? (Not bold in one section, semibold in another for the same role)
   - Is letter-spacing intentional or default everywhere?

**CRITICAL**: The goal isn't to make text "fancier" — it's to make it clearer, more readable, and more intentional. Good typography is invisible; bad typography is distracting.

### Plan Typography Improvements

Create a systematic plan:

- **Font selection**: Do fonts need replacing? What fits the brand/context?
- **Type scale**: Establish a modular scale (e.g., 1.25 ratio) with clear hierarchy
- **Weight strategy**: Which weights serve which roles? (Regular for body, Semibold for labels, Bold for headings — or whatever fits)
- **Spacing**: Line-heights, letter-spacing, and margins between typographic elements

### Improve Typography Systematically

#### Font Selection

If fonts need replacing:
- Choose fonts that reflect the brand personality
- Pair with genuine contrast (serif + sans, geometric + humanist) — or use a single family in multiple weights
- Ensure web font loading doesn't cause layout shift (`font-display: swap`, metric-matched fallbacks)

#### Establish Hierarchy

Build a clear type scale:
- **5 sizes cover most needs**: caption, secondary, body, subheading, heading
- **Use a consistent ratio** between levels (1.25, 1.333, or 1.5)
- **Combine dimensions**: Size + weight + color + space for strong hierarchy — don't rely on size alone
- **App UIs**: Use a fixed `rem`-based type scale, optionally adjusted at 1-2 breakpoints. Fluid sizing undermines the spatial predictability that dense, container-based layouts need
- **Marketing / content pages**: Use fluid sizing via `clamp(min, preferred, max)` for headings and display text. Keep body text fixed

#### Fix Readability

- Set `max-width` on text containers using `ch` units (`max-width: 65ch`)
- Adjust line-height per context: tighter for headings (1.1-1.2), looser for body (1.5-1.7)
- Increase line-height slightly for light-on-dark text
- Ensure body text is at least 16px / 1rem

#### Refine Details

- Use `tabular-nums` for data tables and numbers that should align
- Apply proper `letter-spacing`: slightly open for small caps and uppercase, default or tight for large display text
- Use semantic token names (`--text-body`, `--text-heading`), not value names (`--font-16`)
- Set `font-kerning: normal` and consider OpenType features where appropriate

#### Weight Consistency

- Define clear roles for each weight and stick to them
- Don't use more than 3-4 weights (Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold is plenty)
- Load only the weights you actually use (each weight adds to page load)

**NEVER**:
- Use more than 2-3 font families
- Pick sizes arbitrarily — commit to a scale
- Set body text below 16px
- Use decorative/display fonts for body text
- Disable browser zoom (`user-scalable=no`)
- Use `px` for font sizes — use `rem` to respect user settings
- Default to Inter/Roboto/Open Sans when personality matters
- Pair fonts that are similar but not identical (two geometric sans-serifs)

### Verify Typography Improvements

- **Hierarchy**: Can you identify heading vs body vs caption instantly?
- **Readability**: Is body text comfortable to read in long passages?
- **Consistency**: Are same-role elements styled identically throughout?
- **Personality**: Does the typography reflect the brand?
- **Performance**: Are web fonts loading efficiently without layout shift?
- **Accessibility**: Does text meet WCAG contrast ratios? Is it zoomable to 200%?

Remember: Typography is the foundation of interface design — it carries the majority of information. Getting it right is the highest-leverage improvement you can make.

## Distill

Remove unnecessary complexity from designs, revealing the essential elements and creating clarity through ruthless simplification.

### MANDATORY PREPARATION

Follow the **Foundations** section above, including the Context Gathering Protocol, before proceeding.

---

### Assess Current State

Analyze what makes the design feel complex or cluttered:

1. **Identify complexity sources**:
   - **Too many elements**: Competing buttons, redundant information, visual clutter
   - **Excessive variation**: Too many colors, fonts, sizes, styles without purpose
   - **Information overload**: Everything visible at once, no progressive disclosure
   - **Visual noise**: Unnecessary borders, shadows, backgrounds, decorations
   - **Confusing hierarchy**: Unclear what matters most
   - **Feature creep**: Too many options, actions, or paths forward

2. **Find the essence**:
   - What's the primary user goal? (There should be ONE)
   - What's actually necessary vs nice-to-have?
   - What can be removed, hidden, or combined?
   - What's the 20% that delivers 80% of value?

If any of these are unclear from the codebase, STOP and call the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify.

**CRITICAL**: Simplicity is not about removing features - it's about removing obstacles between users and their goals. Every element should justify its existence.

### Plan Simplification

Create a ruthless editing strategy:

- **Core purpose**: What's the ONE thing this should accomplish?
- **Essential elements**: What's truly necessary to achieve that purpose?
- **Progressive disclosure**: What can be hidden until needed?
- **Consolidation opportunities**: What can be combined or integrated?

**IMPORTANT**: Simplification is hard. It requires saying no to good ideas to make room for great execution. Be ruthless.

### Simplify the Design

Systematically remove complexity across these dimensions:

#### Information Architecture
- **Reduce scope**: Remove secondary actions, optional features, redundant information
- **Progressive disclosure**: Hide complexity behind clear entry points (accordions, modals, step-through flows)
- **Combine related actions**: Merge similar buttons, consolidate forms, group related content
- **Clear hierarchy**: ONE primary action, few secondary actions, everything else tertiary or hidden
- **Remove redundancy**: If it's said elsewhere, don't repeat it here

#### Visual Simplification
- **Reduce color palette**: Use 1-2 colors plus neutrals, not 5-7 colors
- **Limit typography**: One font family, 3-4 sizes maximum, 2-3 weights
- **Remove decorations**: Eliminate borders, shadows, backgrounds that don't serve hierarchy or function
- **Flatten structure**: Reduce nesting, remove unnecessary containers—never nest cards inside cards
- **Remove unnecessary cards**: Cards aren't needed for basic layout; use spacing and alignment instead
- **Consistent spacing**: Use one spacing scale, remove arbitrary gaps

#### Layout Simplification
- **Linear flow**: Replace complex grids with simple vertical flow where possible
- **Remove sidebars**: Move secondary content inline or hide it
- **Full-width**: Use available space generously instead of complex multi-column layouts
- **Consistent alignment**: Pick left or center, stick with it
- **Generous white space**: Let content breathe, don't pack everything tight

#### Interaction Simplification
- **Reduce choices**: Fewer buttons, fewer options, clearer path forward (paradox of choice is real)
- **Smart defaults**: Make common choices automatic, only ask when necessary
- **Inline actions**: Replace modal flows with inline editing where possible
- **Remove steps**: Can signup be one step instead of three? Can checkout be simplified?
- **Clear CTAs**: ONE obvious next step, not five competing actions

#### Content Simplification
- **Shorter copy**: Cut every sentence in half, then do it again
- **Active voice**: "Save changes" not "Changes will be saved"
- **Remove jargon**: Plain language always wins
- **Scannable structure**: Short paragraphs, bullet points, clear headings
- **Essential information only**: Remove marketing fluff, legalese, hedging
- **Remove redundant copy**: No headers restating intros, no repeated explanations, say it once

#### Code Simplification
- **Remove unused code**: Dead CSS, unused components, orphaned files
- **Flatten component trees**: Reduce nesting depth
- **Consolidate styles**: Merge similar styles, use utilities consistently
- **Reduce variants**: Does that component need 12 variations, or can 3 cover 90% of cases?

**NEVER**:
- Remove necessary functionality (simplicity ≠ feature-less)
- Sacrifice accessibility for simplicity (clear labels and ARIA still required)
- Make things so simple they're unclear (mystery ≠ minimalism)
- Remove information users need to make decisions
- Eliminate hierarchy completely (some things should stand out)
- Oversimplify complex domains (match complexity to actual task complexity)

### Verify Simplification

Ensure simplification improves usability:

- **Faster task completion**: Can users accomplish goals more quickly?
- **Reduced cognitive load**: Is it easier to understand what to do?
- **Still complete**: Are all necessary features still accessible?
- **Clearer hierarchy**: Is it obvious what matters most?
- **Better performance**: Does simpler design load faster?

### Document Removed Complexity

If you removed features or options:
- Document why they were removed
- Consider if they need alternative access points
- Note any user feedback to monitor

Remember: You have great taste and judgment. Simplification is an act of confidence - knowing what to keep and courage to remove the rest. As Antoine de Saint-Exupéry said: "Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."

## Polish

### MANDATORY PREPARATION

Follow the **Foundations** section above, including the Context Gathering Protocol, before proceeding. Additionally gather: quality bar (MVP vs flagship).

---

Perform a meticulous final pass to catch all the small details that separate good work from great work. The difference between shipped and polished.

### Design System Discovery

Before polishing, understand the system you are polishing toward:

1. **Find the design system**: Search for design system documentation, component libraries, style guides, or token definitions. Study the core patterns: color tokens, spacing scale, typography styles, component API.
2. **Note the conventions**: How are shared components imported? What spacing scale is used? Which colors come from tokens vs hard-coded values? What motion and interaction patterns are established?
3. **Identify drift**: Where does the target feature deviate from the system? Hard-coded values that should be tokens, custom components that duplicate shared ones, spacing that doesn't match the scale.

If a design system exists, polish should align the feature with it. If none exists, polish against the conventions visible in the codebase.

### Pre-Polish Assessment

Understand the current state and goals:

1. **Review completeness**:
   - Is it functionally complete?
   - Are there known issues to preserve (mark with TODOs)?
   - What's the quality bar? (MVP vs flagship feature?)
   - When does it ship? (How much time for polish?)

2. **Identify polish areas**:
   - Visual inconsistencies
   - Spacing and alignment issues
   - Interaction state gaps
   - Copy inconsistencies
   - Edge cases and error states
   - Loading and transition smoothness

**CRITICAL**: Polish is the last step, not the first. Don't polish work that's not functionally complete.

### Polish Systematically

Work through these dimensions methodically:

#### Visual Alignment & Spacing

- **Pixel-perfect alignment**: Everything lines up to grid
- **Consistent spacing**: All gaps use spacing scale (no random 13px gaps)
- **Optical alignment**: Adjust for visual weight (icons may need offset for optical centering)
- **Responsive consistency**: Spacing and alignment work at all breakpoints
- **Grid adherence**: Elements snap to baseline grid

**Check**:
- Enable grid overlay and verify alignment
- Check spacing with browser inspector
- Test at multiple viewport sizes
- Look for elements that "feel" off

#### Typography Refinement

- **Hierarchy consistency**: Same elements use same sizes/weights throughout
- **Line length**: 45-75 characters for body text
- **Line height**: Appropriate for font size and context
- **Widows & orphans**: No single words on last line
- **Hyphenation**: Appropriate for language and column width
- **Kerning**: Adjust letter spacing where needed (especially headlines)
- **Font loading**: No FOUT/FOIT flashes

#### Color & Contrast

- **Contrast ratios**: All text meets WCAG standards
- **Consistent token usage**: No hard-coded colors, all use design tokens
- **Theme consistency**: Works in all theme variants
- **Color meaning**: Same colors mean same things throughout
- **Accessible focus**: Focus indicators visible with sufficient contrast
- **Tinted neutrals**: No pure gray or pure black—add subtle color tint (0.01 chroma)
- **Gray on color**: Never put gray text on colored backgrounds—use a shade of that color or transparency

#### Interaction States

Every interactive element needs all states:

- **Default**: Resting state
- **Hover**: Subtle feedback (color, scale, shadow)
- **Focus**: Keyboard focus indicator (never remove without replacement)
- **Active**: Click/tap feedback
- **Disabled**: Clearly non-interactive
- **Loading**: Async action feedback
- **Error**: Validation or error state
- **Success**: Successful completion

**Missing states create confusion and broken experiences**.

#### Micro-interactions & Transitions

- **Smooth transitions**: All state changes animated appropriately (150-300ms)
- **Consistent easing**: Use ease-out-quart/quint/expo for natural deceleration. Never bounce or elastic—they feel dated.
- **No jank**: 60fps animations, only animate transform and opacity
- **Appropriate motion**: Motion serves purpose, not decoration
- **Reduced motion**: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`

#### Content & Copy

- **Consistent terminology**: Same things called same names throughout
- **Consistent capitalization**: Title Case vs Sentence case applied consistently
- **Grammar & spelling**: No typos
- **Appropriate length**: Not too wordy, not too terse
- **Punctuation consistency**: Periods on sentences, not on labels (unless all labels have them)

#### Icons & Images

- **Consistent style**: All icons from same family or matching style
- **Appropriate sizing**: Icons sized consistently for context
- **Proper alignment**: Icons align with adjacent text optically
- **Alt text**: All images have descriptive alt text
- **Loading states**: Images don't cause layout shift, proper aspect ratios
- **Retina support**: 2x assets for high-DPI screens

#### Forms & Inputs

- **Label consistency**: All inputs properly labeled
- **Required indicators**: Clear and consistent
- **Error messages**: Helpful and consistent
- **Tab order**: Logical keyboard navigation
- **Auto-focus**: Appropriate (don't overuse)
- **Validation timing**: Consistent (on blur vs on submit)

#### Edge Cases & Error States

- **Loading states**: All async actions have loading feedback
- **Empty states**: Helpful empty states, not just blank space
- **Error states**: Clear error messages with recovery paths
- **Success states**: Confirmation of successful actions
- **Long content**: Handles very long names, descriptions, etc.
- **No content**: Handles missing data gracefully
- **Offline**: Appropriate offline handling (if applicable)

#### Responsiveness

- **All breakpoints**: Test mobile, tablet, desktop
- **Touch targets**: 44x44px minimum on touch devices
- **Readable text**: No text smaller than 14px on mobile
- **No horizontal scroll**: Content fits viewport
- **Appropriate reflow**: Content adapts logically

#### Performance

- **Fast initial load**: Optimize critical path
- **No layout shift**: Elements don't jump after load (CLS)
- **Smooth interactions**: No lag or jank
- **Optimized images**: Appropriate formats and sizes
- **Lazy loading**: Off-screen content loads lazily

#### Code Quality

- **Remove console logs**: No debug logging in production
- **Remove commented code**: Clean up dead code
- **Remove unused imports**: Clean up unused dependencies
- **Consistent naming**: Variables and functions follow conventions
- **Type safety**: No TypeScript `any` or ignored errors
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML

### Polish Checklist

Go through systematically:

- [ ] Visual alignment perfect at all breakpoints
- [ ] Spacing uses design tokens consistently
- [ ] Typography hierarchy consistent
- [ ] All interactive states implemented
- [ ] All transitions smooth (60fps)
- [ ] Copy is consistent and polished
- [ ] Icons are consistent and properly sized
- [ ] All forms properly labeled and validated
- [ ] Error states are helpful
- [ ] Loading states are clear
- [ ] Empty states are welcoming
- [ ] Touch targets are 44x44px minimum
- [ ] Contrast ratios meet WCAG AA
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Focus indicators visible
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] No layout shift on load
- [ ] Works in all supported browsers
- [ ] Respects reduced motion preference
- [ ] Code is clean (no TODOs, console.logs, commented code)

**IMPORTANT**: Polish is about details. Zoom in. Squint at it. Use it yourself. The little things add up.

**NEVER**:
- Polish before it's functionally complete
- Spend hours on polish if it ships in 30 minutes (triage)
- Introduce bugs while polishing (test thoroughly)
- Ignore systematic issues (if spacing is off everywhere, fix the system)
- Perfect one thing while leaving others rough (consistent quality level)
- Create new one-off components when design system equivalents exist
- Hard-code values that should use design tokens

### Final Verification

Before marking as done:

- **Use it yourself**: Actually interact with the feature
- **Test on real devices**: Not just browser DevTools
- **Ask someone else to review**: Fresh eyes catch things
- **Compare to design**: Match intended design
- **Check all states**: Don't just test happy path

### Clean Up

After polishing, ensure code quality:

- **Replace custom implementations**: If the design system provides a component you reimplemented, switch to the shared version.
- **Remove orphaned code**: Delete unused styles, components, or files made obsolete by polish.
- **Consolidate tokens**: If you introduced new values, check whether they should be tokens.
- **Verify DRYness**: Look for duplication introduced during polishing and consolidate.

Remember: You have impeccable attention to detail and exquisite taste. Polish until it feels effortless, looks intentional, and works flawlessly. Sweat the details - they matter.
